          | Hey there, I'm Ryan Perry-Nguyen.  I'm a passionate mobile and web
          | developer.  I started off my dev career doing Android at an online
          | dating company where I got the interview by accident.  Since then,
          | I've done a few more internships doing mobile, web front-end, and
          | back-end jobs here in Canada as well as the Bay Area, in
          | California.  Outside of that I spend my time shooting photos and
          | being almost too picky to ever post them.

            | Tessel to take a picture, gather a temperature reading, and
            | send the data back via another YO.
