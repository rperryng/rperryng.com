    "description": "YoDoorbell was a project born out of Yale's 2014 hackathon - YHack.  The idea of YoDoorbell was to enhance the everyday doorbell.  When a RFID enabled card was present in front of the Tessel, a Yo containing a picture of the guest would be sent to the registered user.  If the user sent a Yo to the \"YoDoorbell\" account the Tessel would take a picture, gather a temperature reading, and send the data right back to you via the Yo API.  YoDoorbell was built using Node.js and ExpressJS for its backend.  Node.js was also used to program the Tessel microcontroller.",
